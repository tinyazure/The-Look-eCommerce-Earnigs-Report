Publicly traded companies in the United States are required to comply with regulations set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of this compliance, every quarter, these companies must prepare and disclose detailed financial statements and earnings reports to their investors and the public. The primary purpose of these disclosures is to ensure transparency, enable investors to make informed decisions, and maintain trust in the financial markets. Timely and accurate earnings reports are crucial, as they can significantly influence a company’s stock price and investor confidence. In addition to quarterly earnings, publicly traded companies must also provide an annual report and promptly disclose any material events that may affect the company’s financial position or operations.
